## Rules

#### Mythwrack

In this streamlined version of the combat rules, combat occurs within a single Round, eliminating sub-round cycles. Defensive Special Effects play a more significant role, and instances of “Draw” results, where nothing happens to combatants, are reduced. AP and initiative advantages are minimized, movement is simplified, and ranged combat is brought on par with melee. Brought to you by Bilharzia on the _Mythras_ Discord.

## Settings

#### Elder Scrolls

A document attempting to capture the feel of the middle 3 mainline games (Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion) with some Skyrim thrown in there. while attempting to sidestep the bulk of the lore messiness. An attempt is made to follow and depict key facets of the lore and mechanics of the games. Huge thanks to Glömmerska and Alphaelectric on the _Mythras_ Discord. No direct download for the PDF is provided as it is a B I G  B O I and Github was throwing a fit.
