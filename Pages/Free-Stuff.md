## Rules & References

#### Mythras Imperative

An 80 page ORC-licensed version of the core system, includes char-gen, combat, Folk Magic & Superpowers and vehicles. Don't think that this is just a cut down version of the rules. There's a lot in here that can be used to run Mythras in almost any setting. The community has helpfully placed the entire thing online for easy access.

## Adventures

#### Shrine of the Traitor Gods

A short scenario designed to introduce those brand new to roleplaying to _Mythras_. This is set in the _Meeros_ setting which, while not a default setting, is used extensively in examples in the core rulebook. Use the pre-generated Characters included with the scenario and the included basic rules to get used to the system.

#### Sariniya's Curse

Another adventure with pre-generated characters in the Meeros setting. This one's a little longer and more difficult. Play this one using the _Mythras Imperative_ or the _Mythras_ Core rules. Either way, continue using the pregenerated characters as everyone gets comfortable with the expanded rules compared to the basic ones in _Shrine of the Traitor Gods_.
