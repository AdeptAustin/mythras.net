#### Meeros Doomed

The City State of Meeros lies broken. Queen Herathos wants the renegade priestess, Kara, brought to justice to atone for her treachery. The characters are tasked with venturing to distant Kopash, and charged with making her arrest.

But is all as it seems? Powerful forces are plotting to destroy _Meeros_ completely, and those who have protected the city may well be the ones who secure its doom. The characters must uncover traitors, travel into monster-infested swamps, confront sorcerous fiends, and perhaps even ally themselves with _Meeros'_ ancient foes, the Badoshi Warlords, if they are to avenge the Doom that has come to _Meeros_!

Finally, encounters for the frontier lands introduce dangerous new magicians and factions
