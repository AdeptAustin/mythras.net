The City State of Meeros lies broken. Queen Herathos wants the renegade priestess, Kara, brought to justice to atone for her treachery. The characters are tasked with venturing to distant Kopash, and charged with making her arrest.

But is all as it seems? Powerful forces are plotting to destroy _Meeros_ completely, and those who have protected the city may well be the ones who secure its doom. The characters must uncover traitors, travel into monster-infested swamps, confront sorcerous fiends, and perhaps even ally themselves with _Meeros'_ ancient foes, the Badoshi Warlords, if they are to avenge the Doom that has come to _Meeros_!

The Iron Simulacrum looks to _Sorandib_ as the place he will discover his fate when the Emperor departs the physical plane, where he might be unmade in such a way as to find the key to a continued existence as an independent soul. _Sorandib_ could be the scene of treason on a world-shattering scale. The cult of Thesh in Taskay has its eye on direct control not only of the Artificers but also of the fire demon Sorantar, who is the city’s god. _Sorandib_ is, in short, a powder keg. And ripe for adventure! This _Thennla_ supplement details _Sorandib_, its people, districts, cults, gods, factions, and magic.

Three self-contained adventures take the adventurers on a raid for a fabled tome, involving them in a nefarious plot by dark forces. Finally, encounters for the frontier lands introduce dangerous new magicians and factions
