## What is an SRD

In the context of TTRPGs (Tabletop Role-Playing Games), an SRD (System Reference Document) serves as a crucial resource. It outlines and details the components of a role-playing game system that creators can legally use. Within the SRD, essential rules, mechanics, and guidelines are provided for building and playing within that system. These typically cover aspects such as character creation, combat rules, magic systems, monsters, and other fundamental elements of the game. Game designers, homebrew creators, and publishers often refer to the SRD when developing new content or adapting existing systems. By adhering to the SRD, creators ensure consistency and compatibility with the core rules while adding their unique twists and expansions.

## Mythras SRDs

### Mythras Imperative

_Mythras Imperative_ is an Open, ORC Licensed, version of the Mythras ruleset. It offers a comprehensive, but not exhaustive, set of rules, including character creation, skills, rules for certain typical situations, combat, and magic – more than enough to get both players and Games Masters started, and form a solid basis for further development. _Mythras Imperative_ is compatible with the _Mythras_ core rules, and other ORC licensed percentile gaming systems. Its companion volume, _Classic Fantasy Imperative_, is also completely compatible and released under ORC, meaning that the two Imperatives can be easily combined.

An 80 page ORC-licensed version of the core system, includes char-gen, combat, Folk Magic & Superpowers and vehicles. Don't think that this is just a cut down version of the rules. There's a lot in here that can be used to run Mythras in almost any setting. The community has helpfully placed the entire thing online for easy access.

### Classic Fantasy Imperative

_Classic Fantasy Imperative_ is an Open, ORC Licensed, version of the _Mythras_ ruleset, focusing on dungeon exploration, high adventure, and tense encounters involving treasure, magic, and deadly foes. _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ emulates the original thrill of the very first roleplaying game in the hobby but approaches it through the lens of the _Mythras_ game system, which is 1d100 (or percentile) based, rather than using a d20.

It offers a comprehensive, but not exhaustive, set of rules, including character creation, character races and classes, skills, rules for certain typical situations, combat, and magic – more than enough to get both players and Games Masters started, and form a solid basis for further development. _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ is completely compatible with _Classic Fantasy_, the _Mythras_ core rules, and _Mythras Imperative_. Plus, it is also compatible with other ORC licensed percentile gaming systems.

A shockingly complete, 155 page, ORC-licensed version of the _Classic Fantasy_ system, includes char-gen, combat, magic, creatures, and treasure. The community has helpfully placed the entire thing online for easy access.
