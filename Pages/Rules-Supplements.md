#### Fenix Papers

The Fenix Papers collects a diverse array of articles, all penned by Pete Nash, and combines them into a single volume. It contains rules expansions, essays, setting ideas, new creatures, scenarios, campaign advice, satire, and all manner of wit and wisdom from the fiendish mind of Mr Nash. Everything in The Fenix Papers can be used with Mythras, but the majority of these articles can also be used in any roleplaying game, irrespective of the polyhedrals employed.

#### The Pheonix

The winner of Design Mechanism's competition to create a phoenix using the Mythras rules, Darvin Martin's entry is wonderfully creative, mixing myth, rules and game play. Not only does Darvin get the three volumes of 'Best of Fenix', we also decided to lay-out and make available his entry.

## Classic Fantasy

#### Classic Fantasy Expert Set

The _Classic Fantasy Expert Set_ is an expansion containing a selection of high level spells for Ranks 4 and 5. Acting as a taster for the full high level expansion - _Unearthed Companion_ - the _Expert Set_ equips _Classic Fantasy_ characters with a selection of Arcane and Divine spells so they can easily advance beyond Rank 3. Also included are rules clarifications for the core game, and a detailed look at a new monster: the Mind Slayer, along with psychic powers for this devious abomination (which can be used by player characters too...)

## Lyonesse

#### Rogues, Rascals, and Rapscallions

Everyone loves a good villain, and the Elder Isles are full of them. 

_Rogues, Rascals, and Rapscallions_ is a resource to the beleaguered Games Master. It has a cornucopia of criminals, a superfluity of scoundrels, a mass of miscreants, and a surfeit of scallywags. The book is divided into five chapters, respectively covering ne'er-do-wells, cults, societies, places, and schemes, each accompanied by multiple stories that can embroil the characters in villainy, either as victims, witnesses, investigators or – heavens forfend! – perpetrators.

Packed full of scenario ideas, intriguing encounters, nefarious nemeses, and exotic locales, Rogues, Rascals and Rapscallions is a must for any campaign, be it Lyonesse or some other fine setting.
