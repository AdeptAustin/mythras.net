# Rulesets

## What do you mean Rulesets?

_Mythras_ as a system is a toolkit and therefore already extremley flexible. But sometimes you don't want something flexible, you want something purpose built to play a certain way, emulate a certain genre, or even just tap into some of your roleplaying roots. The "rulesets" on this page are not necessarily completely different games, but they do have departures from the core rulebook in ways very different from the small modifications that settings or adventures have.

## Core

The _Mythras_ Core Rulebook is the bedrock of the _Mythras_ role-playing game system. It's a toolkit designed to empower Game Masters to create and run the world they've always wanted as well as offer a rich and immersive experience for players. It has a focus on depth, realism, and flexibility.

## Classic Fantasy

_Classic Fantasy_ is technically not a ruleset in and of itself. It's more like a _Mythras_ mod you can use to emulate those old-school dungeon crawls. _Classic Fantasy_ reintroduces class-based game design using the Cult/Brotherhood rules as a template. There's no levels, but there are ranks (based off your skills) you need to achieve to access more class abilities. There's also more of a focus on multiple playable races than the core rulebook. Additionally the book includes new magic rules for Arcane and Divine spellcasting as well as old classic spells like Magic Missle and Fireball. There's rules for miniatures, classic monsters and even pages and pages of treasure and magic items.

The _Mythras_ Core Rulebook is needed to play _Classic Fantasy_
