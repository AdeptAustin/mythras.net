# Welcome to Mythras

## Introduction 

_Mythras_  is a tabletop role-playing game system developed by _The Design Mechanism_. It's a toolkit designed to empower Game Masters to create and run the world they've always wanted as well as offer a rich and immersive experience for players.

For those new to the game, _Mythras_ is a percentile system. In _Mythras_ your characters are defined by their culture, career, community, background, comrades, skills, magic and cults. Progression is through skill advancement – not levels or similarly abstract concepts. As your characters adventure and quest, their capabilities improve and their relationships deepen and strengthen. Players and Games Masters have complete flexibility over what can be achieved, and the way characters develop is entirely dependent on choices players make, depending on their characters’ aspirations and motivations.

Games Masters receive a huge amount of support through the Mythras rules. All the concepts and game mechanics are explained clearly with options and considerations explored and presented for ease of use. You need only this rulebook for many years of exciting and imaginative play.

## New to d100?

_Mythras_ is a d100 or percentile system. Percentile dice, or 1d100, are used to resolve key actions – skill use, combat, magic casting, and so on. It is a roll-under system, meaning that the target number is expressed as a percentage (Athletics 65%, for instance), and both the Games Master and player are looking to roll equal to or less than this target number, using 1d100, to achieve a Success. It is quite easy to replace the 1d100 with a d20 if preferred, and all percentages can be divided by 5 (round up) to gain the target number for a d20 roll. Athletics 65% would become Athletics 13, in our example.

However, 1d100 offers a great deal of flexibility and nuance that underpins the whole game, so our recommendation is to try the 1d100 approach first. While it may seem counterintuitive to have to roll _less_ than something (in many games, higher is usually better!), having a target number expressed as a percentage range that one needs to roll within makes it easy and simple to see your chances of success, and allows for quite a few 'dice tricks,' such as Opposed Rolls, Criticals and Fumbles, and a few other things explored later in these rules. Percentile roleplaying has been around since the earliest days of roleplaying and is a firmly established game system with a tried and tested core mechanic that is flexible, intuitive, and tends to fade into the background during play.
